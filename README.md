# MancalaConcurrent

This is a Java implementation of the 'Mancala Sequence', a sequence I developed while trying to express all possible combinations of cards in a Magic: The Gathering deck.  It works given a number of card types to choose from, the number of cards to be picked for the deck, and a cap on how many cards of a specific type may be picked.

This particular project uses the producer / consumer pattern as a way to exercise my concurrent java programming skills.  In the future, I may tie it in with a M:TG simulator to brute-force test deck combinations for effectiveness.
