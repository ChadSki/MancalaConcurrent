# MancalaConcurrent

This is a Java implementation of the 'Mancala Sequence', a sequence I developed while trying to express all possible combinations of a set of Magic: The Gathering cards for a deck of a given size.

This particular project uses the producer / consumer pattern as a way to exercise my concurrent java programming skills.  In the future, I may tie it in with a M:TG simulator to brute-force test deck combinations for effectiveness.
